## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Thanks to inspiration from various blogs, I learned how I could change the theme of the page, and it turned out to be simpler than I thought.

For the user to save their theme, I learned about using localStorage property.


### Continued development

in future developments, the app should be able to pick the default theme from the users system settings.
